I will post my code below, please let me know if you have any ideas or need more info!</p>\n<p><strong>App.js</strong></p>\n<pre><code>  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = {\n      isLoggedIn: false\n    }\n  }\n\n  handleLogonChange(b) {\n    if(b) {\n      this.setState({\n        isLoggedIn: true\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\nrender() {\n    if (this.state.isLoggedIn) {\n      return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;nav className=&quot;navbar navbar-expand navbar-dark bg-dark&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;/menus&quot; className=&quot;navbar-brand&quot;&gt;\n              Blue Devil Cafe Online\n          &lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;div className=&quot;navbar-nav mr-auto&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/menus&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Menus\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/addmenu&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Add Menu\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/menuitems&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Menu Items\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/addmenuitem&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Add Menu Item\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/nav&gt;\n\n          &lt;div className=&quot;container mt-3&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;Switch&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path={[&quot;/&quot;, &quot;/menuitems&quot;]} component={MenuItemList} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/addmenuitem&quot; component={AddMenuItem} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route path=&quot;/menuitems/:id&quot; component={MenuItem} /&gt;\n\n              &lt;Route exact path={&quot;/menus&quot;} component={MenuList} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/addmenu&quot; component={AddMenu} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route path=&quot;/menus/:id&quot; component={Menu} /&gt;\n            &lt;/Switch&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      )\n    }\n    else {\n      return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;nav className=&quot;navbar navbar-expand navbar-dark bg-dark&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;/menus&quot; className=&quot;navbar-brand&quot;&gt;\n              Blue Devil Cafe Online\n          &lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;div className=&quot;navbar-nav mr-auto&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/home&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Home\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/calendar&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Calendar\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/cart&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Cart\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n              &lt;li className=&quot;nav-item&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;Link to={&quot;/login&quot;} className=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;\n                  Login\n              &lt;/Link&gt;\n              &lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/nav&gt;\n\n          &lt;div className=&quot;container mt-3&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;Switch&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path={&quot;/home&quot;} component={Home} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path={&quot;/calendar&quot;} component={Calendar} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path={&quot;/cart&quot;} component={Cart} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path={&quot;/login&quot;} render={() =&gt; &lt;Login handleLogonChange={this.handleLogonChange}/&gt;} /&gt;\n            &lt;/Switch&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      )\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the user nav:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dTkR8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dTkR8.png\" alt=\"UserNav\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is the admin nav:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTzmA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTzmA.png\" alt=\"AdminNav\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is also the post where I asked days ago on sending data between components:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64900925/how-to-pass-data-between-2-classes-in-reactjs/64901115\">How to pass data between 2 classes in ReactJS</a>?</p>\n","userId":1,"threadId":572,"question_id":64945371,"isQuestion":true,"score":0},

the program works and MusicList.js is capable of getting the items from the backend and logging them. If I dont comment out anything I get the error of &quot;items is undefined&quot; and my logs in MusicList.js show the items array as empty. My leading theory is that paradoxically the error in AppNavbar which shows items are undefined effectively seizes the entire program and MusicList never mounts, and because it never mounts it never gets the items and thus it can never give the items to AppNavbar and so the cycle repeats. I'm not sure if that makes much sense but It's the only thing I can clearly see. However there is still the question of the third component, it manages to load perfectly without error and does not seize up the program like I would expect if I follow the theory above. So I am quite confused as to what the problem is and any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n","userId":1,"threadId":618,"question_id":64944530,"isQuestion":true,"score":0},

{"body":"<p>There is a task that says to develop a program where logo is rendered and one can move it up, down, left or right. When it reaches one of four borders (top, bottom, left or right respectively) the logo should come from the opposite side of border.\nConditions for the logo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the size of the canvas — 400x400px;</li>\n<li>the thickness of the lines — 16px;</li>\n<li>the length of the vertical line — 150px;</li>\n<li>the length of the horizontal line — 100px;</li>\n<li>distance along the X-axis from the vertical to the horizontal (next to each other the border) 22px;</li>\n<li>y-axis distance from vertical to horizontal line — 22px;</li>\n<li>the logo should be centered.</li>\n<li>the logo moves by pressing the arrows on the keyboard: up, down, right, left;</li>\n<li>each movement confuses the entire logo by 25px;</li>\n<li>the movement of the logo should be cyclical — if the logo goes beyond the canvas, then the disappeared part should appear on the opposite side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have already implemented everything that is necessary for the condition. My solution is to slice the logo into 25px squares. When one presses one of the arrow buttons the squares hit 25px path in the corresponding direction. Or if computed X or Y coordinate of some squares is out of border corresponding to the pressed arrow button, this coordinate receives another value that equals “opposite side minus 25px” (the coordinates are computed in the upper-left point).\nWhile testing I get a bug when the logo passes one of the border.
