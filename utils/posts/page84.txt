{"body":"<p>hope you're well. I've been working on a company list component. I am having a problem with updating it in real time, because the axios call I'm sending to 'getById' after it renders is returning only a promise and not the actual data that it is supposed to and I don't have any idea as to why. So when I push the so called new company that I've just added into the array, which is in state, it is only pushing a promise into the array and not the actual <em>Company</em>. I don't have any idea why this is. What the code is supposed to be doing, is it is supposed to be putting the new company into the database, returning the success result, and then I'm using the item from that to make a fresh get call to the axios DB which is supposed to be returning the information I just entered so that I can then insert it into the same array in state that is within the list that is rendered in the company list. However, as I mentioned, only the promise is coming up for some reason.</p>\n<p>At one point I was able to get this working, but I did that by essentially calling, 'componentDidMount' after the promise was pushed into the call back clause of the setState funciton of the push function - which was essentially causing the entire component to re-render. I'm a fairly new coder, but my understanding is is that that is a fairly unconventional way to code something, and contrary to good coding methodologies. I believe I should be able to push it into state, and then have it change automatically. I have attached the relevant code below for you to examine. If you believe you need more please let me know. If someone could please tell me why I am getting this weird promise instead of the proper response object, so that I can then insert that into state, I would greatly appreciate it. I've attached some images below the code snippets that I hope will be helpful in providing an answer. I have also left brief descriptions of what they are.\n:</p>\n<pre><code>class Companies extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      Companies: [],\n      formData: { label: &quot;&quot;, value: 0 },\n    };\n  }\n  componentDidMount = () =&gt; {\n    this.getListCompanies();\n  };\n  getListCompanies = () =&gt; {\n    getAll().then(this.listOfCompaniesSuccess);\n  };\n  listOfCompaniesSuccess = (config) =&gt; {\n    let companyList = config.items;\n    this.setState((prevState) =&gt; {\n      return {\n        ...prevState,\n        Companies: companyList,\n      };\n    });\n  };\n  onCompListError = (errResponse) =&gt; {\n    _logger(errResponse);\n  };\n  mapCompanies = (Companies) =&gt; (\n    &lt;CompaniesList Companies={Companies} remove={remove} /&gt;\n  );\n  handleSubmit = (values) =&gt; {\n    if (values.companyName === &quot;PPP&quot;) {\n      this.toastError();\n      //THIS IS FOR TESTING.\n    } else {\n      add(values)\n        .getById(values.item) //I HAVE TRIED IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES TO GET THE NEW COMPANY IN.

I was also thinking about creating a global event handler that would check the http status code response from all ajax requests, then respond to the codes appropriately i.e. redirect any 404 codes to a not found page for example. There must be a way to achieve this or something similar rather than copying this across every single ajax call?</p>\n<p>The main language I use is C# and I'm a beginner with using JavaScript / jQuery, so any extra explanations would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p><em>jQuery version: 1.10.2</em></p>\n","userId":1,"threadId":863,"question_id":64881238,"isQuestion":true,"score":0},

{"body":"<p>I'm currently building a document like editor using Draft.js and React where the editor has custom blocks generated from previous processing steps and default blocks provided by Draft.js. I've encountered some strange behavior when I 'Drag-and-Drop' custom blocks onto the editor.</p>\n<p>Specifically, if there are default text-like blocks on the editor and you drop a custom block onto where those text-like blocks are, it seems that the text-like block's drop handler is overriding the Editor component's dropHandler. Thus, instead of rendering the custom block, it converts the custom block's props to a string and displays the string.</p>\n<p>Here's a gif of the issue I'm experiencing.

But, this seemed ineffective.</p>\n<p>I've also searched for similar issues that I'm experiencing while reading up on draft.js's documentation and issues but can't seem to make any progress.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to disable the onDrop event/drop handler for default block's in Draft.js? Or is there some other thing that could be overriding the drophandler?</p>\n<p>Any insight or leads in the right direction is greatly appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read.</p>\n","userId":1,"threadId":865,"question_id":64881189,"isQuestion":true,"score":0},

{"body":"<p>I'm trying to make a Discord bot that retrieves a player's stats from the Ubisoft Rainbow Six stat website. I've worked with APIs before and I know the basics of Node and making GET requests to certain URLs. I monitored the network activity for a player's profile and found the specific URL that I need to perform a request on but I get a <code>HTTP 400 error</code>. I'm assuming this is because I've never authenticated with the server who I am. So I read up on authentication and the like and figured that all I had to do was include in the request header my username and password for the website(at this point I should mention that the site makes you login to retrieve player's stats). I went on Postman and included my username/password for Basic Auth and OAuth2 and I still get a <code>HTTP 400 error</code>, so there's obviously got to be more that I'm missing.

{"body":"<p>I have been working on an application. There are multiple components on the page. The content inside them is scrollable. The expected functionality is when I scroll inside the component the hover effects on different elements should be disabled. After searching in the internet I have a working solution. I have created a HoverDisabler component like this,</p>\n<pre><code>import React, {useEffect} from 'react';\n\nexport const HoverDisabler = ({children}) =&gt; {\n  let timer = 0;\n  useEffect(() =&gt; { \n     document.addEventListener('scroll', () =&gt; {\n        clearTimeout(timer);\n        if(!document.body.classList.contains('hoverDisabled')){\n            document.body.classList.add('hoverDisabled');\n        }\n        timer = setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n            document.body.classList.remove('hoverDisabled');\n        },500);\n     }, true); \n  }, []);\n  return children;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The css for hoverDisabled is as follows,</p>\n<pre><code>.hoverDisabled {\n    pointer-events: 'none',\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I am wrapping my root <code>App</code> component with <code>HoverDisabler</code> like this,</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;HoverDisabler&gt;&lt;App /&gt;&lt;/HoverDisabler&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now in all the component, if I start scrolling the <code>hoverDisabled</code> class is added in the body and it gets removed when I stop scrolling. Everything is working perfectly. I am curious if this is the correct approach of having this functionality? Is there any shortcomings of this approach or some problem I am overlooking because of my lack of experience?</p>\n","userId":1,"threadId":935,"question_id":64879626,"isQuestion":true,"score":0},
