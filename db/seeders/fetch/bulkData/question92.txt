I usually used it when typing [raw strings][2] with file paths, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, my convention ended up becoming the use of single quotes on identifier-type raw strings, such as `if (typeof s == &#39;string&#39;) ...` (in which escape characters would never be used - ever), and double quotes for *texts*, such as &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up?&quot;.  I also use single quotes in comments as a typographical convention to show identifier names. This is just a rule of thumb, and I break off only when needed, such as when typing HTML strings `&#39;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt; like so &lt;a&gt;&#39;` (though you could reverse the quotes here also). I&#39;m also aware that, in the case of JSON, double quotes are used for the names - but outside that, personally, I prefer the single quotes when escaping is *never* required for the text between the quotes - like `document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;)`.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, and as some have mentioned/alluded to, to pick a convention, stick with it, and only deviate when necessary.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/two_cents#Noun\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal#Raw_strings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"score":3,"body_markdown":"You can use single quotes or double quotes.\r\n\r\nThis enables you for example to easily nest JavaScript content inside HTML attributes, without the need to escape the quotes.\r\nThe same is when you create JavaScript with PHP.\r\n\r\nThe general idea is: if it is possible use such quotes that you won&#39;t need to escape.\r\n\r\nLess escaping = better code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"score":7,"body_markdown":"When using [CoffeeScript][1] I use double quotes.

JSON.stringify() is often enough. If not, use templates.\r\n\r\n**In favor of double quotes**\r\n\r\n - Doubles are easier to spot if you don&#39;t have color coding. Like in a console log or some kind of view-source setup.\r\n - Similarity to other languages: In shell programming (Bash etc.), single-quoted string literals exist, but escapes are not interpreted inside them. C and Java use double quotes for strings and single quotes for characters.\r\n - If you want code to be valid JSON, you need to use double quotes.\r\n\r\n**In favor of both**\r\n\r\nThere is no difference between the two in JavaScript. Therefore, you can use whatever is convenient at the moment. For example, the following string literals all produce the same string:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n        &quot;He said: \\&quot;Let&#39;s go!\\&quot;&quot;\r\n        &#39;He said: &quot;Let\\&#39;s go!&quot;&#39;\r\n        &quot;He said: \\&quot;Let\\&#39;s go!\\&quot;&quot;\r\n        &#39;He said: \\&quot;Let\\&#39;s go!\\&quot;&#39;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nSingle quotes for internal strings and double for external.
